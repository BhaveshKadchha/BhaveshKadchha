# 👋 Hey there, fellow coder!

I'm a Unity developer who loves diving into new programming languages like a kid in a candy store. 🚀 When I'm not coding, I'm probably thinking about game mechanics, pixel-perfect collisions, or why AI enemies always cheat.

## 🛠️ Languages & Tech I Tinker With:
- **C#** (because Unity, duh!)
- **JavaScript & Node.js** (web magic ✨)
- **C & Zig** (low-level power with modern perks ⚡)
- **Lua** (lightweight and great for scripting!)

## 🚀 What I'm Up To:
- 🎮 Game development in Unity (AR/VR included!)
- 🧪 Experimenting with new programming languages
- 🛠️ Building cool projects and breaking things (then fixing them... mostly 😆)
- 🎨 Exploring game mechanics and design

## 🔗 Let's Connect!

- 🐦 [Twitter](https://x.com/bhavesh_gamedev) *(for random dev thoughts)*
- 💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavesh-kadchha/) *(because networking is a thing)*

Let's build something cool! 🚀
